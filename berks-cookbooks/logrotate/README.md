logrotate Cookbook
==================
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stevendanna/logrotate.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/stevendanna/logrotate)

Manages the logrotate package and provides a definition to manage application specific logrotate configuration.


Requirements
------------
Should work on any platform that includes a 'logrotate' package and writes logrotate configuration to /etc/logrotate.d. Tested on Ubuntu, Debian and Red Hat/CentOS.


Recipes
-------
### global
Generates and controls a global `/etc/logrotate.conf` file that will include additional files generated by the `logrotate_app` definition (see below). The contents of the configuration file is controlled through node attributes under `node['logrotate']['global']`. The default attributes are based on the configuration from the Ubuntu logrotate package.

To define a valueless directive (e.g. `compress`, `copy`) simply add an attribute named for the directive with a truthy value :

```ruby
node['logrotate']['global']['compress'] = 'any value here'
```

Note that defining a valueless directive with a falsey value will not make it false, but will remove it:

```ruby
# Removes a defaulted 'compress' directive; does not add a 'nocompress' directive.
node.override['logrotate']['global']['compress'] = false
```

To fully override a booleanish directive like `compress`, you should probably remove the positive form and add the negative form:

```ruby
node.override['logrotate']['global']['compress'] = false
node.override['logrotate']['global']['nocompress'] = true
```

The same is true of frequency directives; to be certain the frequency directive you want is included in the global configuration, you should override the ones you don't want as false:

```ruby
%w[ daily weekly yearly ].each do |freq|
  node.override['logrotate']['global'][freq] = false
end
node.override['logrotate']['global']['monthly'] = true
```

To define a parameter with a value (e.g. `create`, `mail`) add an attribute with the desired value:

```ruby
node['logrotate']['global']['create'] = '0644 root adm'
```

To define a path stanza in the global configuration (generally unneeded because of the `logrotate_app` definition) just add an attribute with the path as the name and a hash containing directives and parameters as described above:

```ruby
node['logrotate']['global']['/var/log/wtmp'] = {
  'missingok' => true,
  'monthly'   => true,
  'create'    => '0660 root utmp',
  'rotate'    => 1
}
```

`firstaction`, `prerotate`, `postrotate`, and `lastaction` scripts can be defined either as arrays of the lines to put in the script or multiline strings:

```ruby
node['logrotate']['global']['/var/log/foo/*.log'] = {
  'missingok'  => true,
  'monthly'    => true,
  'create'     => '0660 root adm',
  'rotate'     => 1,
  'prerotate'  => ['service foo start_rotate', 'logger started foo service log rotation'],
  'postrotate' => <<-EOF
    service foo end_rotate
    logger completed foo service log rotation
  EOF
}
```


Definitions
-----------
### logrotate_app
This definition can be used to drop off customized logrotate config files on a per application basis.

The definition takes the following params:

- `path`: specifies a single path (string) or multiple paths (array) that should have logrotation stanzas created in the config file. No default, this must be specified.
- `enable`: true/false, if true it will create the template in /etc/logrotate.d.
- `frequency`: sets the frequency for rotation. Default value is 'weekly'. Valid values are: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, see the logrotate man page for more information.
- `dateformat`: specifies date extension with %Y, %m, %d, and %s. The default value is -%Y%m%d.
- `size`: Log files are rotated when they grow bigger than size bytes.
- `maxsize`: Log  files  are  rotated  when  they  grow bigger than size bytes even before the additionally specified time interval.
- `su`: Rotate log files set under this user and group instead of using default user/group.
- `template`: sets the template source, default is "logrotate.erb".
- `template_mode`: the mode to create the logrotate template with (default "0440")
- `template_owner`: the owner of the logrotate template (default "root")
- `template_group`: the group of the logrotate template (default "root")
- `cookbook`: select the template source from the specified cookbook. By default it will use the template from the logrotate cookbook.
- `create`: creation parameters for the logrotate "create" config, follows the form "mode owner group". This is an optional parameter, and is nil by default.
- `firstaction`: lines to be executed once before all log files that match the wildcarded pattern are rotated, before pre-rotate  script is run and only if at least one log will actually be rotated
- `postrotate`: lines to be executed after the log file is rotated
- `prerotate`: lines to be executed before the log file is rotated
- `lastaction`: lines to be executed once after  all  log files  that  match  the  wildcarded  pattern  are rotated, after postrotate script is run  and  only  if  at  least  one  log  is rotated
- `rotate`: Log files are rotated this many times before being removed or mailed.
- `sharedscripts`: if true, the sharedscripts options is specified which makes sure prescript and postscript commands are run only once (even if multiple files match the path)


Usage
-----
The default recipe will ensure logrotate is always up to date.

To create application specific logrotate configs, use the `logrotate_app` definition. For example, to rotate logs for a tomcat application named myapp that writes its log file to `/var/log/tomcat/myapp.log`:

```ruby
logrotate_app 'tomcat-myapp' do
  cookbook  'logrotate'
  path      '/var/log/tomcat/myapp.log'
  frequency 'daily'
  rotate    30
  create    '644 root adm'
end
```

To rotate multiple logfile paths, specify the path as an array:

```ruby
logrotate_app 'tomcat-myapp' do
  cookbook  'logrotate'
  path      ['/var/log/tomcat/myapp.log', '/opt/local/tomcat/catalina.out']
  frequency 'daily'
  create    '644 root adm'
  rotate    7
end
```

To specify which logrotate options, specify the options as an array:

```ruby
logrotate_app 'tomcat-myapp' do
  cookbook  'logrotate'
  path      '/var/log/tomcat/myapp.log'
  options   ['missingok', 'delaycompress', 'notifempty']
  frequency 'daily'
  rotate    30
  create    '644 root adm'
end
```
