Handles path creation as well as the reloading of Ohai so that new data will be available during the same run.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Platforms\n\n- Debian/Ubuntu\n- RHEL/CentOS/Scientific/Amazon/Oracle\n- openSUSE / SUSE Enterprise Linux\n- FreeBSD\n- Windows\n\n### Chef\n\n- Chef 12.7+\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n- none\n\n## Custom Resources\n\n### `ohai_hint`\n\nCreates Ohai hint files, which are consumed by Ohai plugins in order to determine if they should run or not.\n\n#### Resource Attributes\n\n- `hint_name` - The name of hints file and key. Should be string, default is name of resource.\n- `content` - Values of hints. It will be used as automatic attributes. Should be Hash, default is empty Hash\n- `compile_time` - Should the resource run at compile time. This defaults to true\n\n#### Examples\n\nHint file installed to the default directory:\n\n```ruby\nohai_hint 'ec2'\n```\n\nHint file not installed at compile time:\n\n```ruby\nohai_hint 'ec2' do\n  compile_time false\nend\n```\n\nHint file installed with content:\n\n```ruby\nohai_hint 'raid_present' do\n  content Hash[:a, 'test_content']\nend\n```\n\n#### ChefSpec Matchers\n\nYou can check for the creation or deletion of ohai hints with chefspec using these custom matches:\n\n- create_ohai_hint\n- delete_ohai_hint\n\n### `ohai_plugin`\n\nInstalls custom Ohai plugins.\n\n#### Resource Attributes\n\n- `plugin_name` - The name to give the plugin on the filesystem. Should be string, default is name of resource.\n- `path` - The path to your custom plugin directory. Defaults to a directory named 'plugins' under the directory 'ohai' in the Chef config dir.\n- `source_file` - The source file for the plugin in your cookbook if not NAME.rb.\n- `cookbook` - The cookbook where the source file exists if not the cookbook where the ohai_plugin resource is running from.\n- `resource` - The resource type for the plugin file. Either `:cookbook_file` or `:template`. Defaults to `:cookbook_file`.\n- `variables` - Usable only if `resource` is `:template`. Defines the template's variables.\n- `compile_time` - Should the resource run at compile time. This defaults to `true`.\n\n#### examples\n\nSimple Ohai plugin installation:\n\n```ruby\nohai_plugin 'my_custom_plugin'\n```\n\nInstallation where the resource doesn't match the filename and you install to a custom plugins dir:\n\n```ruby\nohai_plugin 'My Ohai Plugin' do\n  name 'my_custom_plugin'\n  path '/my/custom/path/'\nend\n```\n\nInstallation using a template:\n\n```ruby\nohai_plugin 'My Templated Plugin' do\n  name 'templated_plugin'\n  resource :template\n  variables node_type: :web_server\nend\n```\n\n#### ChefSpec Matchers\n\nYou can check for the creation or deletion of ohai plugins with chefspec using these custom matches:\n\n- create_ohai_plugin\n- delete_ohai_plugin\n\n## Maintainers\n\nThis cookbook is maintained by Chef's Community Cookbook Engineering team.
