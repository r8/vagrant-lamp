{"name":"homebrew","version":"4.2.0","description":"Install Homebrew and includes resources for working with taps and casks","long_description":"# Homebrew Cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/homebrew.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/homebrew) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/homebrew.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/homebrew)\n\nThis cookbook installs [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and provides resources for working with taps and casks\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Platforms\n\n- macOS\n\n### Chef\n\n- Chef 12.7+\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n- none\n\n## Attributes\n\n- `node['homebrew']['owner']` - The user that will own the Homebrew installation and packages. Setting this will override the default behavior which is to use the non-privileged user that has invoked the Chef run (or the `SUDO_USER` if invoked with sudo). The default is `nil`.\n- `node['homebrew']['auto-update']` - Whether the default recipe should automatically update Homebrew each run or not. The default is `true` to maintain compatibility. Set to false or nil to disable. Note that disabling this feature may cause formula to not work.\n- `node['homebrew']['formulas']` - An Array of formula that should be installed using Homebrew by default, used only in the `homebrew::install_formulas` recipe.\n\n  - To install the most recent version, include just the recipe name: `- simple_formula`\n  - To install a specific version, specify both its name and version:\n\n    ```\n    - name: special-version-formula\n      version: 1.2.3\n    ```\n\n  - To install the HEAD of a formula, specify both its name and `head: true`:\n\n    ```\n    - name: head-tracking-formula\n      head: true\n    ```\n\n  - To provide other options, specify both its name and options\n\n    ```\n    - name: formula-with-options\n      options: --with-option-1 --with-other-option\n    ```\n\n- `node['homebrew']['casks']` - An Array of casks that should be installed using brew cask by default, used only in the `homebrew::install_casks` recipe.\n\n- `node['homebrew']['taps']` - An Array of taps that should be installed using brew tap by default, used only in the `homebrew::install_taps` recipe. For example:<br>\n  ```ruby\n  [\n    'homebrew/science',\n    # 'tap' is the only required key for the Hash\n    { 'tap' => 'homebrew/dupes', 'url' => 'https://github.com', 'full' => true }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n## Resources (provider)\n\n### homebrew_tap\n\nLWRP for `brew tap`, a Homebrew command used to add additional formula repositories. From the `brew` man page:\n\n```text\nbrew tap [--full] user/repo [URL]\n    Tap a formula repository.\n\n    With URL unspecified, taps a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS.\n    Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for\n    tap user/repo https://github.com/user/homebrew-repo.\n\n    With URL specified, taps a formula repository from anywhere, using\n    any transport protocol that git handles. The one-argument form of tap\n    simplifies but also limits. This two-argument command makes no\n    assumptions, so taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub and\n    using protocols other than HTTPS, e.g., SSH, GIT, HTTP, FTP(S), RSYNC.\n\n    By default, the repository is cloned as a shallow copy (--depth=1), but\n    if --full is passed, a full clone will be used. To convert a shallow copy\n    to a full copy, you can retap passing --full without first untapping.\n```\n\nDefault action is `:tap` which enables the repository. Use `:untap` to disable a tapped repository.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```ruby\nhomebrew_tap 'homebrew/dupes'\n\nhomebrew_tap 'homebrew/dupes' do\n  action :untap\nend\n\nhomebrew_tap 'homebrew/dupes' do\n  url 'https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-dupes.git'\n  full true\nend\n```\n\n### homebrew_cask\n\nLWRP for `brew cask`, a Homebrew-style CLI workflow for the administration of Mac applications distributed as binaries. It's implemented as a homebrew \"external command\" called cask.\n\n[homebrew-cask on GitHub](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask)\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\nYou must have the homebrew-cask repository tapped.\n\n```ruby\nhomebrew_tap 'caskroom/cask'\n```\n\nAnd then install the homebrew cask package before using this LWRP.\n\n```ruby\npackage \"brew-cask\" do\n  action :install\nend\n```\n\nYou can include the `homebrew::cask` recipe to do this.\n\n### Examples\n\n```ruby\nhomebrew_cask \"google-chrome\"\n\nhomebrew_cask \"google-chrome\" do\n  action :uncask\nend\n```\n\nDefault action is `:cask` which installs the Application binary . Use `:uncask` to uninstall a an Application.\n\n[View the list of available Casks](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/tree/master/Casks)\n\n# Usage\n\nWe strongly recommend that you put \"recipe[homebrew]\" in your node's run list, to ensure that it is available on the system and that Homebrew itself gets installed. Putting an explicit dependency in the metadata will cause the cookbook to be downloaded and the library loaded, thus resulting in changing the package provider on Mac OS X, so if you have systems you want to use the default (Mac Ports), they would be changed to Homebrew.\n\nThe default recipe also ensures that Homebrew is installed and up to date if the auto update attribute (above) is true (default).\n\n## License and Authors\n\nThis cookbook is maintained by CHEF.
